## Author

This project is created, and the materials are created, collected and published by me, Denis Dorotenko.<br/>
I am IT/IP Legal Counsel, currently employed at [Yandex LLC](https://yandex.com/company/). <br/>

FYI, much of Yandex open source projects (including published at [corporate account](https://github.com/yandex)) are legally supported by me.<br/>
As another part of my work, I also support corporate cases related to domain names (claims management, UDRP, deals related to acquiring and transfer rights on domain names).

All your ideas, requests, suggestions, work offers and critics are appreciated.<br/>
